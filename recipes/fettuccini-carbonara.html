    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This fettuccine carbonara is a delectable, mouth-watering pile of yummy goodness! I recommend a nice salad with it — that's all you will need for a complete meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 shallots, diced</li>
        <li>1 pound bacon, cut into strips</li>
        <li>1 large onion, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat olive oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Sauté shallots until softened. Stir in bacon and onion; cook and stir until bacon is evenly browned. Stir in garlic when bacon is about half done. Remove from heat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain pasta, then return it to the pot.</p></li>
