    <img src="img/zucchini_dish.webp" alt="zucchini roll lasagna dish">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This incredible zucchini roll lasagna doesn't contain any pasta. Instead, thin zucchini strips are rolled around a 3-cheese filling and baked over a savory turkey Bolognese. The presentation is truly next level.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ricotta 3-cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>For cheese filling: Place ricotta, Parmigiano Reggiano, mozzarella, egg, black pepper, salt, cayenne, and parsley in a bowl, and stir together until combined; refrigerate until needed.</p></li>
        <li><p>For Bolognese: Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet, and add Italian turkey sausage, onions, and a pinch of salt. Cook, breaking up the sausage with a spatula, until browned and broken into small crumbles, 5 to 7 minutes. </p></li>
        <li><p>Stir in marinara sauce, water, and cream and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Sauce can be cooked longer, adding small amounts of water as needed to maintain consistency.</p></li>
    </ol>
