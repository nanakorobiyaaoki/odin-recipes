    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Everyone will love this cowboy spaghetti, a fun twist with bacon, cheese, and pasta in a spicy beef and tomato sauce. The best part is that it’s a one-dish meal, cooked in a cast iron skillet.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 strips bacon</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place bacon in a large cast iron skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until slightly crisp, about 7 minutes. Remove bacon slices to a paper towel-lined plate. When bacon is cool enough to handle, crumble roughly and set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add onion to the same skillet with bacon grease and sauté until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add ground beef. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Lower heat to medium-low, and stir in beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Stir in 1/2 of the crumbled bacon.</p></li>
    </ol>
